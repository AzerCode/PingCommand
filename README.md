# PingCommand
A easy "Ping" JavaScript/Discord.js Command

# Requirements
Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

# Setup
This part tell you exactly how to open a folder using Visual Studio Code, I recommend creating a file specially for your Discord Bot. 

# Step 1
Create a file for your Discord Bot in your Desktop (In my case, I'll name the file "DiscordBot")

# Step 2
Open up command prompt. Type `cd Desktop`. Then, `cd DiscordBot` (What exactly this do is it will navigate to your Discord Bot folder. If your Discord Bot's folder isn't named "DiscordBot", then do `cd <bot folder name>`). Afterwards, type `npm init` (This step requires node.js), it will take few seconds to load, be patient. After it is loaded, key in the informations (It's easy to understand so I will skip this part). Finally, you can `npm install discord.js`, and wait for it to install the package. Now to open Visual Studio Code, simply key in `code .` 

# Step 3
COPY (Only copy the codes in the index.js file. If you want, you can download it.) the index.js file/download.

# Step 4
Go back to your Visual Studio code and upload the file (index.js file) you downloaded. Make sure the index.js file is your main file. To do that, go to your package.json file and change the "main" (It will have a `=` sign, change the file name after the `=` sign to index.js) to index.js. 

# Step 5 (Last part)
Run `node .` in your terminal/command prompt to turn your bot online.

# Honourable mentions
If you're lazy or don't understand, just downlaod all the files.
